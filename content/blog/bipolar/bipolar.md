Bipolar Disorder impacts about 1% of people.

The typical age of onset is 20-25. The earlier the onset, the higher the likelyhood that BD will be a stable feature of that persons psychology.

There are two kinds of Bipolar Disporder. Bipolar I and Bipolar II.

## Bipolar I
### Mania 
Mania is period of very elevated mood, energy, distracivity, impulsivity. This will be very noticable to other people, but not neceseraly to the person having a manic episode.

This will be a persistent state (all day every day) 7 days or more and is not caused by drugs, or something like a seizure etc. So a person can be manic and not have bipolar.


In order to be diagnosed with being in a manic episode, you will have to meet at least 3 of these symptoms, for at least 7 days:
- Distractability (talks about one thing, then goes on about something unrelated, switched subject again, and so on)
- All over the place (like extreme ADHD)
- Impulsivity (spending thousands of dollars on bordgames, then having no money left for food)
- Grandiosity (I am going to win the pulizer price this year. I am selected by the universe to be the next president)
- Flight of ideas (similar to Distractibility, extensively of one thing, then the next extensive subject, goes on forever in a pseudo-random way)
- Agitation (shaking, moving about, can venture into paranoia)
- No sleep (NO sleep, or very little)
- Rapid pressured speech (Hitting you with machine gun fire. No room for conversation. No opertunity for a back and forth)

Unlike Bipolar II, Bipolar I does not need to include a depressive episode.

Percentage wise, people with BDI spend about 50% symptom free. 32% depressed (not being able to sleep, sleeping too much). 15% manic state.


## Bipolar II
- Hypomenia: less intense/shorter duration mania that lasts 4 days or less, or are just not as intense
- Drops into depressive episode


The way that Bipolar can take a lot of different forms (opposed to the "sine wave" idea). There can be a three day hypomania, back to normal, then drop in depression, back to normal, etc. Not necesseraly always just up/down.
They can often be completely symptom free. 

Percentage wise, people with BDII are about 50% in adepressed state (major depression). Symptom free 45%. Hypomania ~5%.

Therefore, Bipolar II can really fall under the radar.


## Heredibility 
The heredibilty of Bipolar Disorder is 85% !

## Neural Circuits of Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity
There are two main neural circuits present both in bipolar/non-bipolar people.
Both circuits do the same thing -- yet in bipolar there seems to be an athrophy/removal of neural connection over time where they become very poor at regestering their own internal state in particular their emotional/somatic states.
Two modes of perception ..
- exteroception (external things happening -- hearing seeing outside of us)
- interoception (how fast is my heart beating, how happy am i, how tired etc)

In people suffering from bipolar over time (especially in second to third decade of having bipolar) seem to have progressively dimished levels of interroception (don't notice how fast they are talking, that they are not sleeping etc).

This athrophy of neural cirucuits for interroception is starting to emmerge as one of the defining neural characteristics or underpinnings of bipolar.

## Lithium
Lithium can protect against some of the neurotoxic effects of neurocircuits being very active.
The reality is people with bipolar very likely have a hyperactivity that ins increasead activity of circuits within their brain early in the expression of the dissease -- this hyperactivity leads to a toxicity (partially death) of certain elements of the neural circuits that are responsible of interroception.
