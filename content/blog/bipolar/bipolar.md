Bipolar Disorder impacts about 1% of people.

The typical age of onset is 20-25. The earlier the onset, the higher the likelyhood that BD will be a stable feature of that persons psychology.

There are two kinds of Bipolar Disporder. Bipolar I and Bipolar II.

## Bipolar I
### Mania 
Mania is period of very elevated mood, energy, distracivity, impulsivity. This will be very noticable to other people, but not neceseraly to the person having a manic episode.

This will be a persistent state (all day every day) 7 days or more and is not caused by drugs, or something like a seizure etc. So a person can be manic and not have bipolar.


In order to be diagnosed with being in a manic episode, you will have to meet at least 3 of these symptoms, for at least 7 days:
- Distractability (talks about one thing, then goes on about something unrelated, switched subject again, and so on)
- All over the place (like extreme ADHD)
- Impulsivity (spending thousands of dollars on bordgames, then having no money left for food)
- Grandiosity (I am going to win the pulizer price this year. I am selected by the universe to be the next president)
- Flight of ideas (similar to Distractibility, extensively of one thing, then the next extensive subject, goes on forever in a pseudo-random way)
- Agitation (shaking, moving about, can venture into paranoia)
- No sleep (NO sleep, or very little)
- Rapid pressured speech (Hitting you with machine gun fire. No room for conversation. No opertunity for a back and forth)

Unlike Bipolar II, Bipolar I does not need to include a depressive episode.

Percentage wise, people with BDI spend about 50% symptom free. 32% depressed (not being able to sleep, sleeping too much). 15% manic state.


## Bipolar II
- Hypomenia: less intense/shorter duration mania that lasts 4 days or less, or are just not as intense
- Drops into depressive episode


The way that Bipolar can take a lot of different forms (opposed to the "sine wave" idea). There can be a three day hypomania, back to normal, then drop in depression, back to normal, etc. Not necesseraly always just up/down.
They can often be completely symptom free. 

Percentage wise, people with BDII are about 50% in adepressed state (major depression). Symptom free 45%. Hypomania ~5%.

Therefore, Bipolar II can really fall under the radar.
